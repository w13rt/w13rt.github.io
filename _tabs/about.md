# Wiert
A medior cybersecurity expert located in the Randstad area. My cyber journey began at [ItVitae](https://itvitae.nl/), where I focused on offensive security. Shortly after that, I was hired by a large financial institution, where Iâ€™ve been working as a red teamer ever since.

I tend to spend my time studing and doing boxes on Hack The Box, working on my home lab or toying with some electronics project. Currently im getting more into harware and IoT/OT hacking, as well as some RF stuff
